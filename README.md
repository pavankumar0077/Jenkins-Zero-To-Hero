Install Jenkins, configure Docker as agent, set up cicd, deploy applications to k8s and much more.

## AWS EC2 Instance

- Go to AWS Console
- Instances(running)
- Launch instances

### Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

### Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins

Install Java

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
```

Verify Java is Installed

```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

- EC2 > Instances > Click on <Instance-ID>
- In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
- Security groups
- Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed `All traffic`).

### Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080    [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After you login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password

Wait for the Jenkins to be restarted.


## Docker Slave Configuration

Run the below command to Install Docker

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```
 
### Grant Jenkins user and Ubuntu user permission to docker deamon.

```
sudo su - 
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker
```

Once you are done with the above steps, it is better to restart Jenkins.

```
http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>:8080/restart
```

The docker agent configuration is now successful.

1) In an Org let us we are working for amazon. People create EC2 instances on Jenkins master and because they are multiple dev's and multiple project teams and multiple dev teams. So Jenkins gets a lot of load to off load these things.
2) So what jenkins does is you should jenkins master only for scheduling purpose. Becuase of the things can not be read on a single JENKINS MASTER.
3) If everything runs on a JENKINS Mater then their will a conflicting pkgs like one team needs java 11 and other team needs java 17. So everything running on MASTER is not good for load and for dependencies as well.
4) Generally people will be cerate one jenkins master and they will create jenkins worker nodes like 1 worker node is for one team like that it will be and it should be. DEVOPS ENGINEERs will catergory the worker nodes like which type of applications or which team should run this worker node like that.

Problem
--
1) From the Above picture Master is 1 EC2 instance and 3 worker nodes are 20 EC2 each
2) Example if there is one team which has no work and mostly sitting idle. SO WASTING THE RESOURCES IN THE AWS INSTANCE
3) If we say like this, We it is not required we stop it. BUT NEVER KNOW WHEN IT IS REQUIRED.
4) ARE if you are configuring a auto-scaling group. but we don't know which team need the worker nodes when


TO SOLVE THE ABOVE PROBLMES THAT IS USING JENKINS WITH DOCKER AS AGENTS

1) The jenkins pipelines are the jenkins stages we will try to run this jenkins pipelines on DOCKER CONTAINERS
2) Advantage of Docker container is if we are using DOCKER CONTIAINER that are light weight against VM or Instances.
3) Very rare cases the dockers concepts may not suites your application like DATABASE.
